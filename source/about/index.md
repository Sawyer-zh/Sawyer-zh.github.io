My name is Hang Zhang, and Sawyer is my English name. 

I graduated from SWPU majoring Petroleum Engineering at 2013, and then I went further study in CUP majoring Oil and Gas Field Development Engineering. When I graduated at 2016, the price of oil was extremely low and the enterprise can't make profit while the internet industry was very popular. In this way, I chose software development Engineer as my career.

I am now a PHPer in a small company, and my technology stack is LNMP. I am attracted by the spirit of freedom in open source software.
